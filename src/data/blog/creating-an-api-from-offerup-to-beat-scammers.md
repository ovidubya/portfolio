# 1. Introduction

> [Offerup.com](https://offerup.com) is an online mobile-first C2C marketplace with an emphasis on in-person transactions. It was founded as a competitor to Craigslist, differentiating itself with mobile-friendly apps and user profiles with ratings as well as the ability to ship nationwide.

Like any other marketplace, there are scammers to watch out for and Offerup is no exception to this. The app is crawling with scammers asking us to pay via \$cashapp before meeting. This has got me thinking...

What if we... extend offerup's filter functionality to filter out the scammers?

**GENIUS!**

But... some questions:

- How are we gonna do it?
- How do we know whose a Scammer?
- How will we get notified?
